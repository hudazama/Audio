# Audio

Hi. These are my personal notes regarding Audio stuff.

I did a research on classifying psychological state (focusing on clinicl depression) based on voice for my Master's degree. Back then I used Matlab and focused more on audio signal analysis, extracted some audio features and classified using simple classifiers like Quadratic Disciminant Analysis. Then I worked as an AI Engineer at a drone company, focusing only on computer vision.

This repo is dedicated to reignite my ❤️❤️ towards Audio AI and to recap some basic audio signal analysis concepts.
