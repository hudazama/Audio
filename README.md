# Audio

Hi. These are my personal notes regarding Audio stuff.

I did a research on classifying psychological states (focusing on Major Depressive Disorder) based on voice for my Master's degree. Back then I used Matlab and focused more on analysing audio signals, extracting some audio features and classifying them using simple classifiers like Quadratic Disciminant Analysis (no Deep Learning stuff). Then I worked as an AI Engineer at a local drone company, focusing only on AI on computer vision.

In short, this repo is dedicated to help me recap some basic audio signal analysis concepts. Audio AI might be might be my next career direction ❤️.
