# Audio

Hi. These are my personal notes regarding Audio stuff.

I did a research on classifying psychological states (focusing on Major Depressive Disorder) based on voice for my Master's degree. Back then I used Matlab and focused more on analysing audio signals, extracting some audio features and classifying them using simple classifiers like Quadratic Disciminant Analysis (no Deep Learning stuff). Then I worked as an AI Engineer at a local drone company, focusing only on AI on computer vision.

In short, this repo is dedicated to reignite my ❤️❤️ towards Audio AI and to recap some basic audio signal analysis concepts.
